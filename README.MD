# About me
Hi! My name is Elroy Parkinson. I live in Johannesburg, South Africa and this is my blog.

I am a Solutions Architect with 20 year's experience as an IT professional. I have a very analytical mind and love finding elegant, simple, cost-effective technical solutions to tough business problems. I am particularly interested in Cloud Architecture, containerization using Kubernetes, Agile software development and Spring Boot micro-services.


I have a Masters Degree in Computer Science from the University of Port Elizabeth (now the [Melson Mandela Metropolitan University](https://www.mandela.ac.za/)) and an MBA from [Charles Sturt University](https://www.csu.edu.au/) in Australia.
